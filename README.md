### Incompatibility is our business

### Prologue
[ASSUMPTION](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/assumption?q=assumptions) a belief or feeling that something is true or that something will happen, although there is no proof. 

### I. Introduction
[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) are two of the most commonly heard terms in web development (i believe), The former is SQL while the latter is NoSQL database, both of them are free to use and suit for production as well as learning purpose. The discussion can be found [here.](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained/nosql-vs-sql)

### II. MySQL
The package I am going to use here is [mysql2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) which supports connection pool and promise, etc. 

### III. MongoDB
Most people refers as schemaless, I would like to call optional schema.
